## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repo  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-/Mohammed-bm/pr-review.git
cd pr-review
```

### 2️⃣ Environment Variables  
Create `.env` files in each folder (`backend/`, `ai-service/`, `frontend/`) using this template:  

#### Example: `backend/.env`  
```env
PORT=5000  
MONGO_URI=[YOUR_MONGO_URI]  
JWT_SECRET=[YOUR_JWT_SECRET]  
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=[YOUR_SECRET]  
GITHUB_TOKEN=[YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN]  
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api  
```

#### Example: `ai-services/.env`  
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=[YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY]  
```

#### Example: `frontend/.env`  
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000  
```

### 3️⃣ Run Each Service (In Separate Terminals)

#### Backend (Node.js)  
```bash
cd backend  
npm install  
npm run dev  
```

#### AI Service (Python + FastAPI)  
```bash
cd ai-services  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
uvicorn main:app --reload  
```

#### Frontend (React.js)  
```bash
cd frontend  
npm install  
npm run dev  
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project has a simple but powerful architecture designed to automate GitHub PR reviews in an easy-to-understand flow, even for beginners.  
Here’s a brief explanation of how it works:

1. **GitHub sends a Pull Request event** to the Webhook endpoint in the Node.js backend.  
2. The backend verifies the event using HMAC SHA-256 signature and stores the PR metadata in MongoDB.  
3. The PR diff files are sent from the Node backend to the Python AI Service (FastAPI).  
4. The AI Service uses LangChain + LangGraph agents to analyze the PR for lint, bugs, security risks, and performance suggestions.  
5. The structured JSON result is returned to the Node backend.  
6. The backend posts the review comments and summary back to the GitHub PR using the GitHub API.  
7. Meanwhile, all PR reviews are saved in MongoDB and displayed in a React Dashboard with an intuitive UI.
